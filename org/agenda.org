** Get bonus points when practicing

#+attr_latex: :width 200px
[[../img/datacamp2.png]]
- You can get 10 bonus points if you keep a practice streak of 10 days
- You can do this up to 3 times for a maximum of 30 points, which will
  be applied to your weakest final grade category
- Submit a screenshot of your mobile (or desktop) streak in Canvas
- If you lose your streak between day 5 and 10, you still get 5 points
- On the dashboard, DataCamp will suggest practice categories for you,
  and also in the mobile app
- This option ends on May 3rd (last day of spring term)
- You can get this bonus only in one of my courses (if you attend > 1)

** GNU Treats: ~speed-type~, ~treemacs~ and ~gtypist~

- An attractive alternative to ~Dired~ is the ~treemacs~ package. It
  looks like this on my PC (and also works for the terminal Emacs):
  #+attr_latex: :width 400px
  [[../img/t_treemacs.png]]

- If you want to be faster on the keyboard, try [[https://www.gnu.org/savannah-checkouts/gnu/gtypist/gtypist.html#:~:text=GNU%20Typist%20(also%20called%20gtypist,the%20GNU%20General%20Public%20License.][GNU Typist]], a free
  10-lesson online trainer for increasing your typing skills.
  #+attr_latex: :width 400px
  [[../img/gtypist.png]]

- There is also an Emacs package to practice touch/speed typing in
  Emacs called ~speed-type~. You have to install it with ~M-x
  package-list-packages~, then find the package in the list and install
  with ~i~ and ~x~. [[https://github.com/dakra/speed-type][More information on GitHub.]]

b* Week 6 - Bag of words III - text cleaning
#+attr_latex: :width 400px
[[../img/4_cleaning.jpg]]

- Onward: Cleaning and preprocessing text (3rd part of DataCamp lesson 1)
- Part I: cleaning with ~tm~ and ~qdap~ functions
- Part II: using stopwords dictionaries
- Get ~4_cleaning_practice.org~ [[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/birkenkrahe/tm/main/org/4_cleaning_practice.org][from GitHub]] to code alongside me
- When finished, upload the file to Canvas

** DataCamp: all assignments & test 2 are live now
#+attr_latex: :width 400px
[[../img/canvas1.png]]

- Test 2 deadline: Friday, Feb 17 at 11:59 pm - open book!
- Don't leave the DataCamp assignments to the very end!

** Review questions for test 2

- Questions we have yet to review come from the last lecture:

  1) [X] counting characters, e.g. for "ChatGPT is an OpenAI bot"
     #+begin_src R
       nchar("Rhett knew the answer to this one")
     #+end_src

     #+RESULTS:
     : [1] 33

  2) [X] data in a ~factor~ vector - example: make a factor vector with
     the levels "up" and "down" and with elements
     ~{"up","up","down","up"}~ - is this ~factor~ ordered?
     #+begin_src R
       factor(
         c("up","up","down","up","down","down"),
         levels=c("down","up"),
         ordered=TRUE) -> fc
       fc
       is.ordered(fc)
     #+end_src

     #+RESULTS:
     : [1] up   up   down up   down down
     : Levels: down < up
     : [1] TRUE

  3) [X] Which functions show you the data of a dataframe,
     e.g. ~mtcars~?
     #+begin_src R
       mtcars |> str()
       mtcars |> head()
     #+end_src

     #+RESULTS:
     #+begin_example
     'data.frame':	32 obs. of  11 variables:

     #+end_example

  4) [X] Which functions show you the data of a text corpus?
     E.g. the 999th element of ~coffee_corpus~:
     #+begin_src R :results silent
       library(tm)
       coffee_df <- read.csv("~/Downloads/coffee.csv") # dataframe
       coffee_vec <- coffee_df$text # vector
       coffee_src <- VectorSource(coffee_vec) # source
       cc <- VCorpus(coffee_src)  # corpus
     #+end_src
     #+begin_src R
       ## with content()
       content(cc[[2]])
       ## with index operator [] 
       cc[[2]][1]
       ## with inspect()
       inspect(cc[[2]])
       ## NOT with meta()
       meta(cc[[2]])
     #+end_src

     #+RESULTS:
     #+begin_example
     [1] "RT @bryzy_brib: Senior March tmw morning at 7:25 A.M. in the SENIOR lot. Get up early, make yo coffee/breakfast, cus this will only happen ?"
     $content

  5) [X] Extract the 2nd tweet of the list ~LIST~:
     #+begin_src R :results silent
       LIST <- list(letters=LETTERS[1:4],
                    numbers=1:100,
                    tweets=coffee_vec)
     #+end_src

     #+begin_src R
       LIST[["tweets"]][999]
      #+end_src

      #+RESULTS:

[fn:3] No /assessment bias:/ independent judgements, diverse
understanding, local knowledge and tabulated results.

[fn:2] Structured data is data in rectangular structures (e.g. tables)
whose rows are records or observations, and whose columns are feature
vectors or attributes. A vector of length N can also be printed as a
rectangular structure of dimension N x 1 (N rows, 1 column):
#+begin_src R
  vec <- c("jim", "joe", "jan", "bud")
  vec
  matrix(vec)
  matrix(vec,nrow=1)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: [1] "jim" "joe" "jan" "bud"
:      [,1]
: [1,] "jim"
: [2,] "joe"
: [3,] "jan"
: [4,] "bud"
:      [,1]  [,2]  [,3]  [,4]
: [1,] "jim" "joe" "jan" "bud"

[fn:1] Proposal, literature review, presentation or essay, IMRaD
(Introduction, Method, Results and Discussion) structure.
