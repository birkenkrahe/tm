2) [X] Which two text mining /techniques/ did we discuss?
3) [X] What is a "Document Term Matrix" (DTM)
4) [X] What is the difference between /syntactic/ and /semantic/?

Practice session:
1) [X] How can you see which R packages are currently loaded?
2) [X] How to get vector type, length and no. of characters?
3) [X] Which plot type is suitable to visualize a TDM?
4) [X] What is a nominal, what is an ordinal factor vector?

DataCamp lesson review:
1) [X] What is a /volatile corpus/?
2) [X] What are the steps to get a volatile corpus from a vector?
3) [X] What's the difference to getting a corpus from a dataframe?
4) [X] What data structure are source and corpus stored in?

- 10-15 multiple choice questions, 15-20 minutes time
- test online in class between 2.30 pm and 2.50 pm
- followed by a quick test review
- the test will be opened for unlimited attempts afterwards

- You only have to complete the first third of the lesson
- Send me a screenshot for proof
- See [[https://lyon.instructure.com/courses/1015/discussion_topics/2088][Canvas announcement]]

- If you inform me beforehand that you cannot attend an announced
  test, we can make arrangements for you to take the test outside of
  class.

** Finish first practice file and upload it

- Open your practice file with Emacs in ~Downloads~:
  #+begin_example sh
    emacs --file  1_bag_of_words_practice.org
  #+end_example

- Open Canvas, find the [[https://lyon.instructure.com/courses/1015/assignments/5896][assignment]] and upload the org file
  #+attr_latex: :width 400px
  [[../img/canvas.png]]

- Download the next practice file [[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/birkenkrahe/tm/main/org/3_corpus_practice.org][from GitHub]], save it as
  ~3_corpus_practice.org~ and open it in Emacs during the lecture.

** How should you study for data science tests?

- If you were successful in the test: what did you do?
- If not: what do you think you should have done?

* Footnotes

[fn:3] No /assessment bias:/ independent judgements, diverse
understanding, local knowledge and tabulated results.

[fn:2] Structured data is data in rectangular structures (e.g. tables)
whose rows are records or observations, and whose columns are feature
vectors or attributes. A vector of length N can also be printed as a
rectangular structure of dimension N x 1 (N rows, 1 column):
#+begin_src R
  vec <- c("jim", "joe", "jan", "bud")
  vec
  matrix(vec)
  matrix(vec,nrow=1)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: [1] "jim" "joe" "jan" "bud"
:      [,1]
: [1,] "jim"
: [2,] "joe"
: [3,] "jan"
: [4,] "bud"
:      [,1]  [,2]  [,3]  [,4]
: [1,] "jim" "joe" "jan" "bud"

[fn:1] Proposal, literature review, presentation or essay, IMRaD
(Introduction, Method, Results and Discussion) structure.
