- [ ] What are "structured data" in the context of text mining?[fn:2]
- [ ] What does assessment bias refer to ("wisdom of crowds")[fn:3]

* Footnotes

[fn:3] No /assessment bias:/ independent judgements, diverse
understanding, local knowledge and tabulated results.

[fn:2] Structured data is data in rectangular structures (e.g. tables)
whose rows are records or observations, and whose columns are feature
vectors or attributes. A vector of length N can also be printed as a
rectangular structure of dimension N x 1 (N rows, 1 column):
#+begin_src R 
  vec <- c("jim", "joe", "jan", "bud")
  vec
  matrix(vec)
  matrix(vec,nrow=1)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: [1] "jim" "joe" "jan" "bud"
:      [,1] 
: [1,] "jim"
: [2,] "joe"
: [3,] "jan"
: [4,] "bud"
:      [,1]  [,2]  [,3]  [,4] 
: [1,] "jim" "joe" "jan" "bud"
