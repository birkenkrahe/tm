[[../img/review.png]]

Introduction to Bag-of-Words:
1) [X] What is a /corpus/ in the context of text mining?
2) [X] Which two text mining /techniques/ did we discuss?
3) [X] What is a "Document Term Matrix" (DTM)
4) [X] What is the difference between /syntactic/ and /semantic/?

Practice session:
1) [ ] How can you see which R packages are currently loaded?
2) [ ] How to get vector type, length and no. of characters?
3) [ ] Which plot type is suitable to visualize a TDM?
4) [ ] What is a nominal, what is an ordinal factor vector?

DataCamp lesson review:
1) [ ] What is a /volatile corpus/?
2) [ ] What are steps to get a volatile corpus from a vector?
3) [ ] What's the difference to getting a corpus from a dataframe?
4) [ ] What data structure are source and corpus stored in?

* TODO Test 1 on Tuesday (31 Jan)
#+attr_latex: :width 400px
[[../img/mining.png]]

- 10 multiple choice questions, 15 minutes time
- test online in class from 2.30 pm to 2.50 pm

* TODO [[https://lyon.instructure.com/courses/1015/assignments/5895][DataCamp lesson due next Tuesday (31 Jan)]]
#+attr_latex: :width 400px
#+caption: Late or missed the test? Talk to me!

* TODO Condition for repeating tests
#+attr_latex: :width 400px
#+caption: Late or missed the test? Talk to me!
[[../img/late1.jpg]]

- If you inform me beforehand that you cannot attend an announced
  test, we can make arrangements for you to take the test outside of
  class.

* TODO Finish first practice file and upload it

- Open your practice file with Emacs in ~Downloads~:
  #+begin_example sh
    emacs --file  1_bag_of_words_practice.org
  #+end_example
- Open Canvas, find the [[https://lyon.instructure.com/courses/1015/assignments/5896][assignment]] and upload the org file
  #+attr_latex: :width 400px
  [[../img/canvas.png]]
  
* TODO How should you study for data science tests?
#+attr_html: :width 200px
[[../img/studying.jpg]]

- If you were successful in the test: what did you do?
- If not: what do you think you should have done?

* TODO Project - first sprint review (Tuesday, Feb 7)
#+attr_html: :width 400px
[[../img/sprint.png]]

- The term project purpose is down to you - or you can approach me for
  an idea (but please do that sooner than later)!

- There are many different ways to present a paper or a slide pack:
  e.g. succinct, verbose, opinionated, objective, accessible or not.

- Your first deliverable is a *project proposal* formatted as an
  Org-mode file. Here is a template for such a file with definitions.

  1) Meta data: preliminary title (~#+TITLE~), list of team members
     (~#+AUTHOR:~), course title (~#+SUBTITLE~).

  2) Headlines: ~Problem~, ~Reason~, ~Constraints~, ~Goals and Non-goals~,
     ~Metrics~, ~References~

     - *Problem*: describe the problem that you're trying to solve.

     - *Reason*: why is this problem interesting (to you) right now?

     - *Constraints:* which difficulties, e.g. technical or conceptual,
       do you foresee right now?

     - *Goals and non-goals*: list all goals that you might want to
       achieve with this project. Order the goals by importance. Add a
       list of non-goals, i.e. things that are outside the scope of
       your project.

     - *Metrics*: how would you measure the success of your project?

     - *References*: list any references that you found already. Make
       sure that they are consistent (same format) and complete
       (author, date, title, place).

- Upload your result to Canvas (*no later than Feb 7, 12 pm*). Missing
  the deadline will cost you points.

* Footnotes

[fn:3] No /assessment bias:/ independent judgements, diverse
understanding, local knowledge and tabulated results.

[fn:2] Structured data is data in rectangular structures (e.g. tables)
whose rows are records or observations, and whose columns are feature
vectors or attributes. A vector of length N can also be printed as a
rectangular structure of dimension N x 1 (N rows, 1 column):
#+begin_src R 
  vec <- c("jim", "joe", "jan", "bud")
  vec
  matrix(vec)
  matrix(vec,nrow=1)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: [1] "jim" "joe" "jan" "bud"
:      [,1] 
: [1,] "jim"
: [2,] "joe"
: [3,] "jan"
: [4,] "bud"
:      [,1]  [,2]  [,3]  [,4] 
: [1,] "jim" "joe" "jan" "bud"

[fn:1] Proposal, literature review, presentation or essay, IMRaD
(Introduction, Method, Results and Discussion) structure.
