- We're going to work with text data only (no maps[fn:1])
- You can complete the "Text mining with R" track
- You will complete one DataCamp chapter per week
- In class, we will prepare and review the online material
- You will cover some of the most important AI/ML applications
  
* How will you be evaluated?

- All course requirements have deadlines
- Late submissions will be penalized (loss of points)
- No final exam! But weekly tests are graded
- The project topic can come from any of the course sub-topics
- The project deliverable is an essay of at least 5,000 words

* Which tools are you going to use?

- [[https://app.datacamp.com/learn/skill-tracks/text-mining-with-r][DataCamp courses]] (15 weekly home assignments)
- [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/tm][GitHub repository]] (all course materials except tests)
- [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/org/blob/master/FAQ.org][GNU Emacs + ESS + R]] (literate programming environment)
- [[https://lyon.instructure.com/][Canvas]] (learning management system)

* How can you register at DataCamp?

#+caption: DataCamp assignments for January
[[../img/0_assignments.png]]

- You find the invitation link to the group for Spring 23 [[https://lyon.instructure.com/courses/1015/pages/course-links][in Canvas]].
- You will automatically be subscribed to the Digital Humanities team
- If you are in more than one course, I will add you later manually
- These accounts will be valid until July 8, 2023 only
  
* When is the first assignment due?
#+attr_html: :width 300px

[[../img/0_test.jpg]]

- The first DataCamp home assignment is due on January 17. For late
  submissions, you lose 1 point per day (out of 10 possible points)

- The first in-class assignment is due on January 19. For late
  submissions, you lose 1 point per day (out of 10 possible points)
  
- We'll write the first weekly multiple-choice test on January 19.

* What should we do as a project?

- The *final essay* should be about one of the areas of Digital
  Humanities that we have *not* covered in our text mining course

- [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/tm/blob/main/img/0_chatgpt.png][Here is the set of available essay topics]] (generated by an AI)

- Also possible: "Topic modeling" (non-assigned DataCamp chapter),
  full chapter in the book by Kwartler - ML approach with clustering

- An interesting approach would be if everyone picked the same topic
  related to text mining, ChatGPT being an obvious current "hot
  topic", and investigated different aspects, e.g. technical, ethical,
  societal, and personal aspects of the chatbot or this type of bot.

- You need to do your own research, including a literature review, and
  adhere to the IMRaD framework (see video):
  1) Introduction (what did you want to research?) with abstract
  2) Method (what did you do?) with literature review
  3) Results (what did you find out?) with examples, illustrations
  4) Discussion (what does it mean?) with limitations and outlook
  
* What else could you do for a good start?

1) Complete/review introductory R or statistics courses:
   - [[https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/free-introduction-to-r][Introduction to R" in DataCamp]] (data structures)
   - [[https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/introduction-to-statistics][Introduction to statistics]]
   - [[https://github.com/matloff/fasteR][fasteR by Norman Matloff (GitHub)]] - fast lane to R

2) If you do not have any experience with Emacs, work through the
   *online tutorial* (open it in Emacs with ~CTRL + h t~) - ca. 1 hour.
   - Learn to open/close the editor
   - Learn basic cursor control (moving around)
   - Learn basic file management (open/close/find/save files)
   - Learn basic windows (buffer) management

* What are you looking forward to?

- Learning more about text mining using the ~tidyverse~
- Unlocking the secrets of natural language processing
- Having fun with R programming and real data sets
- Helping you on your own "digital humanities" journey

* Footnotes

[fn:1]Maps and GIS (Geographic Information Systems) are super cool but
deserve an introductory course on their own. The focus of my teaching
is to get you practical experience that you can use on the job instead
of a broad conceptual overview (though the latter would be easier for
all of us).
