* What else could you do for a good start?

1) Complete/review introductory R or statistics courses:
   - [[https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/free-introduction-to-r][Introduction to R" in DataCamp]] (data structures)
   - [[https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/intermediate-r][Intermediate R]] (conditionals, functions, loops, utilities)
   - [[https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/introduction-to-statistics][Introduction to statistics]]
   - [[https://github.com/matloff/fasteR][fasteR by Norman Matloff (GitHub)]] - fast lane to R
   - [[https://github.com/matloff/fastStat][fastStat by Norman Matloff (GitHub)]] - fast lane to statistics

2) If you do not have any experience with Emacs, work through the
   *online tutorial* (open it in Emacs with ~CTRL + h t~) - ca. 1 hour.
   - Learn to open/close the editor
   - Learn basic cursor control (moving around)
   - Learn basic file management (open/close/find/save files)
   - Learn basic windows (buffer) management

3) Get the 2019 textbook by [[https://www.packtpub.com/product/machine-learning-with-r-third-edition/9781788295864][Lantz, Machine Learning with R (3e)]] and
   read the first chapter (it's free even without buying it).
   - There are many other books (most of them not all that good)
   - Stay away from "cookbooks" (ML with Keras or TensorFlow)

4) Install WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) on your PC, then learn
   the command line with [[https://linuxcommand.org/tlcl.php][Shotts' book (5e, 2023)]].
