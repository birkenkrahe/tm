- We will complete 50% of the "Text mining with R" DataCamp track

- You will complete one DataCamp chapter per fortnight

- In class, we will prepare and review the online material

- You will cover some of the most important AI/ML applications

* How will you be evaluated?

#+caption: DataCamp assignment for January
[[../img/0_assignments.png]]

- You find the invitation link to the group for Spring 23 [[https://lyon.instructure.com/courses/1015/pages/course-links][in Canvas]].

- You will automatically be subscribed to the Digital Humanities team

- If you are in more than one course, I will add you later manually

- These accounts will be valid until July 8, 2023 only

* When is the first assignment due?
#+attr_latex: :width 300px
[[../img/0_test.jpg]]

- The first DataCamp home assignment is due on *January 24*. For late
  submissions, you lose 1 point per day (out of 10 possible points)

- The first in-class assignment is due on January 24. For late
  submissions, you lose 1 point per day (out of 10 possible points)

- We'll write the first weekly multiple-choice test on January 24.

* What should we do as a project?
#+attr_html: :width 400px

[[../img/0_imrad.png]]

- The *final essay* or the *researched presentation* should
  be about one of the areas of Digital Humanities that we did *not*
  cover in our course

- [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/tm/blob/main/img/0_chatgpt.png][Here is the set of available essay topics]] (generated by an AI)

- Also possible: "*Topic modeling*" (available as [[https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-text-analysis-in-r/topic-modeling?ex=1][DataCamp lesson]]), full
  chapter in the book by Kwartler - ML approach with clustering

- Technical, ethical, societal, and personal aspects of ChatGPT (here
  are [[https://lablab.ai/t/chatgpt-guide][some use cases]]):
  1) A psychology major could contrast "Eliza" and "ChatGPT" or test
     [[https://lablab.ai/event/openai-whisper-hackathon/Boss/Butter]["Butter"]], a chatbot for individuals that stutter
  2) An English major could check ChatGPTs writing abilities
  3) A CompSci major could look at ChatGPT's technical implementation

- You need to do your own research, including a literature review, and
  adhere to the IMRaD framework (see video):
  1) *Introduction* (what did you want to research?) with abstract
  2) *Method* (what did you do?) with literature review
  3) *Results* (what did you find out?) with examples, illustrations
  4) *Discussion* (what does it mean?) with limitations and outlook

* What else could you do for a good start?

[[../img/0_gnuemacs1.png]]

If you do not have any experience with Emacs, work through the
*online tutorial* (open it in Emacs with ~CTRL + h t~) - ca. 1 hour.
- Learn to open/close the editor
- Learn basic cursor control (moving around)
- Learn basic file management (open/close/find/save files)
- Learn basic windows (buffer) management

*See my during my office hours for a personal tutorial!*

* What are you looking forward to?

#+Caption: Cover of Text Mining In Practice With R by Ted Kwartler (Wiley, 2010)
[[../img/0_kwartler.jpg]]

- Text mining in practice: Bag of Words and Syntactic Parsing

- Base R data structures, functions and packages, importing data

* Footnotes

[fn:1]Maps and GIS (Geographic Information Systems) are super cool but
deserve an introductory course on their own. The focus of my teaching
is to get you practical experience that you can use on the job instead
of a broad conceptual overview (though the latter would be easier for
all of us). There is also a spring'23 GIS course in anthropology
@Lyon.
