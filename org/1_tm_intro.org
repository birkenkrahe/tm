* Why should you care about text mining?
#+begin_quote
"To be truly *customer-centric* in a *hyper-competitive* environment, an
organization should be listening to their constituents whenever
possible. Yet the amount of textual information from these
interactions can be immense, so text mining offers a way to extract
insights quickly." Kwartler, 2019
#+end_quote

*Examples:*

- *Relevance* of social media for public opinion (e.g. Twitter)

- *Growth* of online content from an organization (e.g. blogs)

- *Digitization* of paper records (e.g. healthcare)

- *Automatic* translation of natural language (e.g. Google Translate)

- *Augmentation* of human work through chatbots (e.g. ChatGPT)

#+begin_quote
"Under the right circumstances, groups are remarkably intelligent, and
are often smarter than the smartest people in them." Surowiecki, 2005
#+end_quote

The "right circumstances": no assessment bias =
1) Assessors need to exercise /independent/ judgements
2) Assessors need to possess /diverse/ information understanding
3) Assessors need to rely on /decentralized/, /local/ knowledge.
4) There has to be a way to /aggregate/ or tabulate the results.

- [ ] How about Amazon.com reviews - do they meet these
  conditions?[fn:4]

* Beneficiaries and benefits of text mining
#+attr_latex: :width 400px
#+caption: Applications that use text mining
[[../img/1_benefits.jpg]]

- Benefits include:
  1) Trust among stakeholders because little to no /sampling/ is needed
     to extract information (all available text sources can be used).
  2) The methodologies can be applied quickly (text processes fast).
  3) Using R allows for /auditable/ and /repeatable/ methods.
  4) Text mining identifies novel /insights/ or reinforces existing
     perceptions based on all relevant information.

  chatbot represent *"vox populi"*? Are all criteria fulfilled?[fn:5]

- [X] Whom would you trust more - the expert author or the
  chatbot, and why?[fn:6]

* When to use and when not to use text mining
#+attr_html: :width 400px
#+caption: Example use cases and recommendations for text mining
[[../img/1_use_cases.png]]

- /"Use case"/: an application scenario used for illustration

- /Lists/ should always be ordered (explicitly or implicitly)

- [ ] How could one order the list of example use cases?[fn:9]

* Language is not like other data

- [X] What is special about language data?[fn:7]

- "The true origin of language may never be known." ([[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/tm/blob/main/img/1_language.png][ChatGPT]])

- Text mining reduces the information available in language

* Avoid word clouds - beware of the clich√©

- Use them in conjunction with other methods to confirm the
  correctness of a conclusion

* NEXT Basic text mining workflow
#+attr_latex: :width 400px
#+caption: Tex mining workflow from Kwartler (2019)
[[../img/1_workflow.png]]

1. *Define* the problem and specific goals (e.g. how best to market)

2. *Identify* the text that needs to be collected (e.g. Twitter API)

3. *Organize* the text (e.g. into a corpus for "bag of words")

4. *Extract* features for analysis (e.g. make text lower case)

5. *Apply* techniques to the prepared text (e.g. keyword search)

6. *Reach* an insight or recommendation (e.g. marketing focus)

* Which tools are needed?
#+attr_latex: :width 400px

[[../img/1_tools.jpg]]

- Sufficient RAM for R (all processing is done in memory)

- Installation of R and an IDE like RStudio or Emacs + ESS + Org-mode

- Set of R packages and example data

- Any operating system (Linux is to be preferred)

* Simple example: mining customer reviews
#+attr_latex: :width 200px
[[../img/1_nike.jpg]]

- You're a Nike employee who wants to know how consumers are viewing
  the Nike Men's Roshe Run Shoes. Follow these steps:

  1) *Goal definition*: Using online reviews, identify overall positive
     or negative views. For negative views, identify cause to be
     shared with the product manager.

  2) *Data collection*: For a mass market product, use retail website
     like Amazon for hundreds of timestamped reviews (to ensure
     currency).

  3) *Text organisation*: Web scrape all reviews into a CSV file with one
     review per row, timestamp and star rating to later subset corpus
     by these features.

  4) *Feature extraction*: clean reviews to analyze text features,
     e.g. removing common words with little benefit ("shoe", "nike",
     "running" etc.). Check for spelling and make all text lowercase.

  5) *Text analysis*: scan for specific group of keywords depending on
     product issues ("fit", "rip", "tear", "narrow", "wide",
     "sole"). Sum group counts to order problematic features.

  6) *Insight generation*: present findings to product manager that the
     top consumer issue is "narrow" and "fit" to aid product design,
     marketing or improvement decisions.

* Real world example: competitive intelligence

- Text mining can help to understand the basics of a competitor's text
  based marketing (for further analysis, contrast or imitation)

- When creating Amazon.com's social customer service team, they were
  "obsessed with how others were doing it".

- They read and reviewed other companies customer replies and learnt
  from their missteps.[fn:8]

- In 2012, social media based customer service was considered to be
  highly risky, involving legal counsel, branding, and leadership.

- In 2012, Wal-Mart, Dell and Delta Airlines were considered best in
  class social customer service companies.

- Each brand owner (Amazon Prime, Amazon Kindle etc.) had cultivated
  their own style of communicating via social media (like dialects).

- Every communication channel was supposed to execute flawlessly and
  be 100% customer-centric.

- Goal: develop social media cautiously to maintain current quality
  set by multiple stakeholders.

- Initial channels: two help forums, retail and Kindle Facebook pages
  and Twitter.

- Text mining was a tool to analyze competitors' use of social media
  for customer services: length of a reply (e.g. Twitter limit),
  language used, typical customer agent workload, and if posting
  similar links repeatedly made sense, what types of help links to
  post (forms, resource links?), how many people should be doing this,
  etc.

- Text mining focused on three questions for about one year:
  1) What is the average length of a social customer service reply?
  2) What links were referenced most often?
  3) How many social replies is reasonable for a customer service
     agent to handle?

- By 2017, Amazon was a leading force in this space ([[https://etaileast.wbresearch.com/blog/amazons-engaged-buyers-drive-social-media-revenue][WBR, 2023]])

* Footnotes
[fn:9]Alphabetically, by importance (to someone), by number of
applications, by number of users, by time (history).

[fn:1]Distillation is a process of extracting an essence (a wanted
substance) and getting rid of unwanted substances. Actionable insights
are insights that one can use to make decisions (action in business is
usually accompanied by decision-making).

[fn:2]([[https://www.ibm.com/topics/text-mining][Source]]) Structured data are data in tabular format with
specific data types for digital processing. Unstructured data do not
have a specific data format.

[fn:3]The Org-mode file is semi-structured! Semi-structured data carry
meta information in the form of markup - e.g. HTML, XML, JSON, or
Org-mode: the header information at the top of the file structures the
data, as does the Org-mode format itself, which comes with a markup
language.

[fn:4] (1) reviews may not be independent since reviewers have access
to old reviews, which may influence them (it's harder to have a
different opinion from everyone else). (2) Diversity is hard to
measure but in the case of Amazon.com, a national audience can be seen
as highly diverse (there are nearly 150 mio subscribers of Amazon
Prime in the US alone). (3) Local here means "not only at a
distance" - only "verified purchase" reviews fulfil this condition in
principle. (4) Tabulation of the reviews relies on text mining, and
hence - unlike in the case of Galton - not on recording simple
numbers. Stochastic procedures (probability distributions) are
involved.

[fn:5]ChatGPT is source from a very large number of textual documents
but it is impossible to ascertain any of the criteria when identfying
the chatbot as the "assessor".

[fn:6]For me personally, knowledge about a source increases trust in
believing that source while lack of knowledge decreases the trust. In
the case of ChatGPT, I asked the bot about its sources but its answer
was redundant and not overly satisfying ([[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/tm/blob/main/img/1_chatgpt_1.png][see for yourself]]).

[fn:7]Language is used for communication; it is thought to be divine
or at least strongly linked to the divine ("In the beginning was the
Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God." John 1:1); it
may be that only humans have language; it is learnt.

[fn:8]This reminds me of my own experience with CISCO customer
services when working at Shell and visiting CISCO to (openly) learn
from their knowledge sharing experiences.
