* What is "text mining"?
#+begin_quote
"Text mining is the process of distilling actionable insights from
text." Kwartler, 2019
#+end_quote

- [ ] What does "distilling actionable insights" mean?[fn:1]

#+begin_quote
"Text [data] mining is the process of transforming unstructured text
into a structured format to identify meaningful patterns and new
insights." IBM, 2023
#+end_quote

- [ ] What does "structured" and "unstructured data" mean? What are
  "meaningful patterns"?[fn:2]

- [ ] What about the text on this page: structured or not?[fn:3]

* What is text mining in practice (= business)?

- Identify useful social media posts for customer services

- Measure campaign success for marketing purposes

- Match job descriptions to resumes for human resources

* Why should you care about text mining?
#+begin_quote
" To be truly customer-centric in a hyper-competitive environment, an
organization should be listening to their constituents whenever
possible. Yet the amount of textual information from these
interactions can be immense, so text mining offers a way to extract
insights quickly." Kwartler, 2019
#+end_quote

Concrete examples:

- Relevance of social media for public opinion (e.g. Twitter)

- Growth of online content from an organization (e.g. blogs)

- Digitization of paper records (e.g. healthcare)

- Automatic translation of natural language (e.g. Google Translate)

- Augmentation of human work through chatbots (e.g. ChatGPT)

* Vox populi - the "wisdom of crowds"

#+begin_quote
"Under the right circumstances, groups are remarkably intelligent, and
are often smarter than the smartest people in them." Surowiecki, 2005
#+end_quote

The "right circumstances": no assessment bias =
1) Assessors need to exercise /independent/ judgements
2) Assessors need to possess /diverse/ information understanding
3) Assessors need to rely on /decentralized/, /local/ knowledge.
4) There has to be a way to /aggregate/ or tabulate the results.

- [ ] How about Amazon.com reviews - do they meet these
  conditions?[fn:4]

* Beneficiaries and benefits of text mining
#+attr_html: :width 500px
[[../img/1_benefits.jpg]]

- Benefits include:
  1) Trust among stakeholders because little to no /sampling/ is needed
     to extract information (all available text sources can be used).
  2) The methodologies can be applied quickly (text processes fast).
  3) Using R allows for /auditable/ and /repeatable/ methods.
  4) Text mining identifies novel /insights/ or reinforces existing
     perceptions based on all relevant information.

- [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/tm/blob/main/img/1_chatgpt.png][The "opinion" of ChatGPT]] looks comprehensive as always - does this
  chatbot represent "vox populi"? Are all criteria fulfilled?[fn:5]

- [ ] Whom would you trust more - the expert author or the
  chatbot?[fn:6]

* When to use and when not to use text mining
#+attr_html: :width 600px
[[../img/1_use_cases.png]]

- "Use case": an application scenario used for illustration

- Lists should always be ordered (explicitly or implicitly)

- [ ] How could one order the list of example use cases?
* Language is not like other data

- [ ] What is special about language data?[fn:7]

- The origin of language is not known (ChatGPT 01/06/2023)

* Footnotes

[fn:7]Language is used for communication; it is thought to be divine
or at least strongly linked to the divine ("In the beginning was the
Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God." John 1:1); it
may be that only humans have language; it is learnt.

[fn:6]For me personally, knowledge about a source increases trust in
believing that source while lack of knowledge decreases the trust. In
the case of ChatGPT, I asked the bot about its sources but its answer
was redundant and not overly satisfying ([[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/tm/blob/main/img/1_chatgpt_1.png][see for yourself]]).

[fn:5]ChatGPT is source from a very large number of textual documents
but it is impossible to ascertain any of the criteria when identfying
the chatbot as the "assessor".

[fn:4] (1) reviews may not be independent since reviewers have access
to old reviews, which may influence them (it's harder to have a
different opinion from everyone else). (2) Diversity is hard to
measure but in the case of Amazon.com, a national audience can be seen
as highly diverse (there are nearly 150 mio subscribers of Amazon
Prime in the US alone). (3) Local here means "not only at a
distance" - only "verified purchase" reviews fulfil this condition in
principle. (4) Tabulation of the reviews relies on text mining, and
hence - unlike in the case of Galton - not on recording simple
numbers. Stochastic procedures (probability distributions) are
involved.

[fn:1]Distillation is a process of extracting an essence (a wanted
substance) and getting rid of unwanted substances. Actionable insights
are insights that one can use to make decisions (action in business is
usually accompanied by decision-making).

[fn:2]([[https://www.ibm.com/topics/text-mining][Source]]) Structured data are data in tabular format with
specific data types for digital processing. Unstructured data do not
have a specific data format.

[fn:3]The Org-mode file is semi-structured! Semi-structured data carry
meta information in the form of markup - e.g. HTML, XML, JSON, or
Org-mode: the header information at the top of the file structures the
data, as does the Org-mode format itself, which comes with a markup
language.
